/**
 * How a release of the app is judged: a canary is compared with the version it replaces (its baseline), not with the
 * objectives, because the app is broken on purpose and the baseline already fails some of them. A fix that leaves
 * those as they are is no worse. Argo Rollouts' analysis is generated from this file (`factory`'s
 * `release/analysis.ts`), and `make check` fails if the generated templates are out of date.
 *
 * The steps (how much of the traffic the canary takes, and for how long) are the app's, in its repository's
 * `deploy/`; the judgement is here, so nothing in the app's repository can loosen it. These figures are a start, and
 * Martin's to change.
 *
 * Three measures, at each step and throughout the release: errors and latency from Prometheus, over every route at
 * once, and the journeys: the same comparison the app's pull requests pass (a check that passes on the baseline and
 * fails on the canary, twice), run against the two Services. The journeys have no thresholds of their own.
 *
 * After a release is promoted, Verify asks the sense that saw a ticket's defect whether it has cleared on the new
 * version (`verify`).
