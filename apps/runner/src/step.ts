/**
 * What a runner's job is told, through its environment, and what it hands back. The line writes the first and reads
 * the second (`apps/factory/src/runners`); the shapes are here so both sides agree.
 *
 *     RUNNER_STEP   the step, as JSON (`Step`)
 *     WORK          the job's volume, which lives as long as the work item (default /work)
 *     PREPARE       the prepare pod's own folder, empty each time, for what it must not share with the agent
 *
 * The agent pod also has ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (the gateway), ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (its job token, which is not a key) and
 * HANDBACK_URL (the line's handback endpoint). The prepare pod has neither.
 *
 * A step that asks for a result has the agent write it as JSON to `$WORK/out/result.json`: on the volume, outside the
 * checkout, so it is never part of the patch. The agent pod reads it and hands it back beside the patch; the line
 * checks it against the agent's own schema. A field of prose, such as a pull request's description, the agent writes
 * as a file of its own beside the result (`resultFiles`): Markdown is easier to write well as a file than inside a
 * JSON string. The agent pod reads each into its field.
