/**
 * Runs a sense on a schedule, and again at once when the app's version changes, and turns what it finds into
 * signals. The rules are the milestone's decisions:
 *
 * - A check that passes writes nothing, and ends its streak.
 * - A check that fails becomes a signal only when it has failed twice in a row, so one blip opens nothing. After
 *   that each failing run sends another, which triage counts without making an event of it.
 * - Never two runs at once, and a run that the app changed under is thrown away and repeated.
 *
 * The clock and the polling are the caller's: `tick()` does one poll of the version, and `start()` calls it on a
 * timer. Tests call `tick()` themselves.
