/**
 * The crawler: a sense that follows every link, image, script and stylesheet from the home page, and checks what it
 * finds by the checks any site should pass (`judge.ts`). The runner treats it as it does the probes: a finding
 * becomes a signal only when it has failed twice in a row.
 *
 * A check here is a symptom class on a route, named `<symptom>@<route>`, such as `missing-header@/about`. Every route
 * crawled has one for every class the crawler looks for, so a class that stops being found passes, and its streak
 * ends. A class found on every page crawled is one finding on `*` instead of one on each route.
