/**
 * The scope fence: a runner's patch may change only the files its spec's scope names. The line checks every patch
 * before the GitHub worker sees it, so a patch outside its scope never reaches GitHub. It is deterministic, and the
 * agent's own words have no part in it.
 *
 * A scope entry is a file (`src/money.ts`), a folder ending in `/` (`test/`), or a pattern with `*` (one path
 * segment) or `**` (any number). Whatever the scope says, a patch may never change the workflows, the deployment, or
 * a path the repository's CODEOWNERS gives a person.
 *
 * Its output is what a reader of a refusal needs to judge it: the scope, then each file the patch changes, allowed or
 * refused, with the lines it adds and removes.
