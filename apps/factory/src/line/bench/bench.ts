/**
 * The bench: one agent's step on a developer's machine, with no cluster, for working on the agent's prompt. It runs
 * the step as a runner does, with the runner's own prepare and agent steps, on a fixture's invented work, against a
 * gateway on the host. It has no network fence: the agent has the machine's network.
 *
 * What makes a second run send the same requests, so the gateway's cassettes replay it: the step works in a fixed
 * folder, `BENCH_DIR`, since its path is in the prompt; the agent's home is emptied before each run, so no session,
 * setting or memory of an earlier one (or of the developer's own Claude Code) reaches it; and it has none of the
 * developer's environment but `PATH`, and no git settings but the checkout's. The prepare step commits a fixture's
 * seed under a fixed message at a fixed time, and gives the checkout's files that time; the gateway keys a call
 * without the date and a test run's times. The folder is the developer's own, in their home's cache, so no other
 * user of the machine can plant anything in it, and two developers' benches never wipe each other's.
 *
 * The step takes a job token like any other, so the gateway audits each call in `model_calls` with the job, and the
 * bench counts from there how many calls a model answered and how many the cassettes replayed. The token names a work
 * item of its own for each run, not the fixture's: the gateway caps what a work item spends over all time, so runs
 * that shared one would soon use up its cap for good. The prompt keeps the fixture's, so the cassettes still replay.
 *
 * A coder's patch meets the scope fence, as on the line (`fenceFor`). One the fence refuses goes back to the coder,
 * as the line sends it (`coderInputAfterRefusal`), up to `LIMITS.fenceRefusals`: another step, from a fresh
 * checkout, carrying on the coder's session as its definition says (`resume`).
 *
 * A step that reads a change, the reviewer's, has it committed on the base after the prepare step, at the seed's
 * time, as a pull request's head; the base is named `base`, as the prepare step names a real step's base.
