/**
 * A review as GitHub shows it: a comment review, with each finding anchored to its line, and a check run beside it.
 * Both are signals, never gates: the review only comments, so it never counts toward a merge, and the check run is
 * one no ruleset requires, which the line leaves out of the gates it reads (`gates.ts`).
 *
 * GitHub refuses a whole review if one comment is anchored to a line the pull request's diff does not show, so each
 * finding is checked against the diff first. One anchored elsewhere is not lost: it goes in the review's body, with
 * where the reviewer put it.
 *
 * A finding's thread is answered and resolved once the finding is: a blocking finding or a suggestion a later review
 * finds put right, with the commit it reviewed, and a suggestion the coder declines, with its reason; and every
 * finding still open of a held review Martin approves in the console, saying he accepted it. So is the thread of every
 * earlier finding it held again (`lineage`). The app's `main` merges nothing with a review thread open. The
 * thread is found by its comment, as this module wrote it, and the line it was made on.
