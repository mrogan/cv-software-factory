/**
 * What a dry run reads back: the branches, commits and pull requests it would have made, answered as GitHub would
 * have answered for them, and everything else read from GitHub as it is. Without this, a line in `dry-run` reads a
 * pull request numbered past a billion, which GitHub has never heard of, and waits at Gates for ever.
 *
 * A pull request the dry run opened reads as open, its head the last commit it would have pushed. Each commit it
 * would have made has every check main's ruleset requires, each passing once `checksAfterMs` has passed since the
 * commit; and the pull request reads as merged, by the App, once it is ready for review and `mergeAfterMs` has
 * passed since it was readied, so the work item ends and a soak goes round. A draft is never merged: GitHub cannot
 * merge one, and Martin merges only what the describer has readied. Nothing ran: each check's title says so, and the gate's summary carries
 * it. A comparison of a commit the dry run made is taken against the real commit its first one went on, from the
 * files as they really are there and as the dry run left them. A step that starts from such a commit checks out that
 * real commit and makes the dry run's commits on it (`checkout`), so the reviewer, the describer and a later round of
 * the coder see the change as GitHub would have held it.
 *
 * Its memory is the dry run's (`DryRunActions`), and lasts as long as the worker: a worker started again has
 * forgotten the pull requests it opened, and GitHub answers that it has none at those numbers.
