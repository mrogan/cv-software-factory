/**
 * Cassettes for agents' calls: a Messages API response, recorded so that a runner's step can be replayed exactly,
 * call by call, and a step run again after a change pays only from the first call that differs.
 *
 * Two runs of the same agent on the same work send requests that differ in a few places: the request's metadata (a
 * session id); the date written into the prompt; the times the tools the agent runs print, such as how long Vitest
 * and Biome took and when the checkout's files were written; and the order of the results of tools the agent ran at
 * once, which come back as each finishes. The key leaves out the first three, without the colours a tool printed
 * them in, and puts those results in the order of their ids. Runners work in a fixed folder, on a seed committed at
 * a fixed time, so everything else that reaches the key is the work itself. A tool's time the key does not know
 * ends a replay at the call it reaches. The provider is part of the key, so a local model's recording never stands
 * in for Claude's.
 *
 * A cassette is `<key>.json` beside the judgements' cassettes, and holds the request as keyed and the response body
 * as it came over the wire: JSON, or the server-sent events of a stream.
