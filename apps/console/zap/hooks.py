"""
ZAP's baseline scan of the console, as Martin's signed-in browser (`scan.ts` starts it): every request ZAP sends
carries his session's cookie and its token, as his browser's do, and it reads the pages and routes its spider cannot
find in the page's HTML, which the page's script draws or calls. It writes nothing that would change the factory: the
two writes it sends are the first halves of signing in and enrolling, which make a challenge and nothing else.
