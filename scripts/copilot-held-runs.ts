/**
 * Deletes the runs of the review gate's two workflows that GitHub held for Copilot, which leave a red cross behind.
 *
 *     node scripts/copilot-held-runs.ts             # in copilot-held-runs.yml, every half hour on main
 *     node scripts/copilot-held-runs.ts --dry-run   # says what it would delete, and deletes nothing
 *
 * GitHub treats Copilot as an outside contributor, so a review of Copilot's that leaves comments starts a run of
 * `review requested` (review-requested.yml) that is held for a maintainer's approval before any job starts, and fails
 * when its pull request closes. That failure starts `review` (review.yml) on main's head commit, as Copilot, held too.
 * Only Martin's reviews count, so neither has anything to judge, and a re-run is no fix: it keeps Copilot as the actor,
 * so the `review` run it starts is held in turn. Deleting a held run removes it and its check suite, and runs nothing.
 *
 * A run is deleted only when all of these hold, read from the run's id, workflow file, actors, status and conclusion,
 * and its count of jobs; nothing else of the run is read, its branch and title least of all:
 *
 * - it is a run of review-requested.yml or review.yml, by its workflow file;
 * - Copilot, by its account's id, login and type, both started it and triggered this attempt of it, so a run Martin
 *   re-ran is his to keep;
 * - it is completed, and was held (`action_required`) or failed (`failure`);
 * - it has no job, in any attempt: GitHub held it before it ran anything.
 *
 * So a held run of anyone else's, a fork's above all, waits for Martin's approval as before, and a run that did
 * something is kept, whatever became of it.
 *
 *     GH_TOKEN             the workflow's token, which may write Actions: list runs and their jobs, and delete runs
 *     GITHUB_REPOSITORY    as Actions sets it
 *     GITHUB_API_URL       as Actions sets it, or GitHub's
